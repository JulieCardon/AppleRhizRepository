I have 150 samples of V3-V4 region amplicons.  The average file size is around 35 MB.  The DNA was extracted from the soil surrounding apple tree rootstocks of different genotypes.  I'm interested in seeing if the microbial communities differ depending on rootstock genotype, especially if there is a pattern differentiating those that are resistant to Apple Replant Disease from those that are susceptible.
